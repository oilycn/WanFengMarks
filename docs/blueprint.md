## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Slate blue (#778DA9) to convey a sense of calm, stability, and reliability.
- Background color: Very light gray (#E0E1DD) to maintain a clean and uncluttered backdrop, allowing the bookmark icons to stand out without distraction.  This is appropriate for a light color scheme.
- Accent color: Pale, muted blue (#A3B18A). This is approximately 30 degrees to the left of the primary color on the color wheel. It's desaturated and softened in brightness for understated contrast and harmonious visual balance.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', sans-serif, for a modern, neutral, and readable appearance. Its clarity makes it ideal for quick scanning of bookmarks and time display.
- Employ a consistent style of minimalist, line-based icons for bookmarks to ensure clarity and visual consistency across different categories.
- Utilize a flexible grid layout for the bookmarks that adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices, ensuring a consistent user experience regardless of the user's device.
- Incorporate subtle hover effects and transitions to provide visual feedback and enhance the interactive feel of the page, such as a gentle scaling effect on bookmark icons or a smooth color transition on the search bar.
